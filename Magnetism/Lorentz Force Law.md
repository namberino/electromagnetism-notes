Magnetic fields also move charges. Specifically, the force on a charge from a magnetic field is equal to this:

$$
\vec{F} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}
$$

This means if a particle is not moving or has no velocity ($\vec{v} = 0$, $\vec{0} = q\vec{0} \times \vec{B}$) then there's no magnetic force or the particle is moving parallel to the magnetic field ($0 = qvB \sin(0)$). Once the particle starts moving slightly perpendicular to the magnetic field, the charge experiences a force that's both perpendicular to its velocity and the magnetic field, specifically with the cross product.
